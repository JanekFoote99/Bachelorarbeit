# Document Template HS Coburg

This repository provides a student-maintained and improved version of the
so far available FEIF document template. The template got reworked from
the ground up, improving the author's experience and providing a cleaner
interface to begin with.

While being a template, the project provides some useful commands and
allows the user to further customize and extend it.

You can find an [example document](https://github.com/btoschek/hsc-template/blob/example/Arbeit.pdf)
based on this template (including a small overview of features) over on the
[example](https://github.com/btoschek/hsc-template/tree/example) branch.

> ⚠️ **INFO**: The template is set up to only support German (despite this README
> and the source code being commented and written in English).
